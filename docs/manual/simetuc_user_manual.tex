\part{User Guide}


\chapter{Installation}

Python 3.5 is required. Installing Anaconda is recommended; it works
with Windows (64/32 bits), Linux (64/32 bits) and Mac (64 bits).

After installing \href{https://www.continuum.io/downloads}{Anaconda}
execute the following command at the command prompt (\emph{cmd.exe}
for Windows, \emph{shell} for Linux and Mac):\footnote{Some OSX users report problems using \emph{conda}, if after installing
you can't use the program (i.e., \emph{simetuc -h} fails because \emph{simetuc}
wasn't recognized as a command), use \emph{pip install simetuc.}}

\begin{lstlisting}
conda install -c pedvide simetuc
\end{lstlisting}


or

\begin{lstlisting}
pip install simetuc
\end{lstlisting}


That will download and install all necessary files.


\section{Update}

If you installed it using \emph{conda}, update with:

\begin{lstlisting}
conda update -c pedvide simetuc
\end{lstlisting}


If you installed it with \emph{pip}, update with:

\begin{lstlisting}
pip install -U simetuc 
\end{lstlisting}



\chapter{The configuration file}

Some sections of the configuration file are mandatory (Sections \ref{sub:Version}-\ref{sub:Decay}),
some are optional (Sections \ref{sub:Branching-ratios}-\ref{sub:Optimization-Method}),
and some are only mandatory when performing a particular simulation
type (Sections \ref{sub:Power-Dependence} and \ref{sub:Concentration-Dependence}).

Comments can be placed anywhere in the file starting with a hash symbol
(\#).

The different sections of the file begin by a section name, for example
lattice or states, followed by a colon (:). The different subsections
and values are in a new line and indented with four spaces (not tabs!).
A section can contain a single value or subsections; for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
# comment1
section1: value1
section2:
    subsection1: value2 # comment2
    subsection2:
        subsubsection1: value3
\end{lstlisting}


Some of the values may be text or numbers, others, however, may be
lists or a list of lists. A list is written as a comma-separated values
between two square brackets:

\begin{lstlisting}
section: [item1, item2, item3]
\end{lstlisting}


And for a list of lists:

\begin{lstlisting}
section: [[lst1_item1, lst1_item2], [lst2_item1, lst2_item2]]
\end{lstlisting}


A full example of a configuration file, showing all options, is shown
in Listing \ref{lst:full_conf_file}.


\section{\label{sub:Version}Version}

At the moment, there is only one format for the configuration file;
however, in the future, it is possible that an improved format is
introduced that is not compatible with the current one. For this reason
the version of the format has to be included, the only value allowed
is 1:

\begin{lstlisting}
version: 1
\end{lstlisting}



\section{Lattice\label{sub:Lattice}}

This section defines the name of the lattice, the unit cell parameters,
the concentration of sensitizer and activator ions, and optionally,
a maximum distance of interaction.

This section starts with
\begin{lstlisting}
lattice:
    # values and subsections...
\end{lstlisting}


Those values and subsections are described now.
\begin{description}
\item [{The~name}] is an arbitrary text that describes the lattice. It
will be used as a folder name under latticeData (Section \ref{sub:The-latticeData-folder}),
expData (Section \ref{sub:The-expData-folder}), and results (Section
\ref{sec:The-results-folder}). Therefore it should only contain letters,
numbers, and underscore (\_) characters (no spaces).
\item [{The~number~of~unit~cells}] is an integer greater than zero.
It specifies how many unit cells along the three directions a lattice
will consist on. 
\item [{The~concentration}] of sensitizer and activator, in percentages
from 0 to 100\%. An ion with 0\% concentration will not participate
in the equations and therefore will not make the simulation take longer.
\begin{lstlisting}
    S_conc: 0
    A_conc: 0.3
\end{lstlisting}

\item [{The~unit~cell~parameters}] consist on the three lattice distances
and three angles. The distances are given in Angstrom and the angles
in degrees (between 0 and 360º). 
\begin{lstlisting}
    # distances in Angstrom
    a: 5.9738
    b: 5.9738
    c: 3.5297
    # angles in degree
    alpha: 90
    beta: 90
    gamma: 120
\end{lstlisting}

\item [{The~spacegroup}] determines the symmetry of the lattice. It can
be given as the international short symbol (e.g., P-6) or as the International
Union of Crystallography number (e.g. 174). 
\item [{The~sites}] positions and occupancies determine the positions
of the doped ions (in units of the lattice distances, from 0 to 1)
and their fractional occupancy (between 0 and 1). For a lattice with
just one site: 
\begin{lstlisting}
    sites_pos: [0, 0, 0]
    sites_occ: 1
\end{lstlisting}
For a lattice with two sites, the second of which is half occupied:
\begin{lstlisting}
    sites_pos: [[0, 0, 0], [2/3, 1/3, 1/2]]
    sites_occ: [1, 1/2]
\end{lstlisting}
The sites are populated randomly using the desired concentration,
see Section \ref{sec:Creating-a-lattice}.
\end{description}
A full example of the lattice section is

\begin{lstlisting}
lattice: # all fields here are mandatory
    name: bNaYF4
    N_uc: 40
    S_conc: 0
    A_conc: 0.3
    # unit cell
    # distances in Angstrom
    a: 5.9738
    b: 5.9738
    c: 3.5297
    # angles in degree
    alpha: 90
    beta: 90
    gamma: 120
    spacegroup: P-6
    # info about sites.
    sites_pos: [[0, 0, 0], [2/3, 1/3, 1/2]]
    sites_occ: [1, 1/2]
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection{Optional values}
\begin{description}
\item [{The~maximum~distances}] for the normal and cooperative interactions
restrict energy transfer to ions closer than the distances. The normal
maximum distance (\texttt{d\_max}) is not yet implemented; however,
the cooperative one is, and it's strongly recommended to use it if
cooperative interactions are present. The cooperative interactions
grow approximately with the cube of the number of ions, the normal
interactions grow with the square.\\
If the values are not present, they are set to infinite.
\begin{lstlisting}
lattice:
    ... all other fields ... 
    d_max: 100.0
    d_max_coop: 25.0
\end{lstlisting}

\end{description}

\section{States\label{sub:States}}

This section determines the number of energy states per ion and their
labels.

Four subsections are mandatory, two per ion type:
\begin{description}
\item [{The~ion~labels}] is any text that describes the sensitizer or
activator ion. It usually is the ion's chemical symbol.
\item [{The~ion~states~labels}] is a list of text. Each item in the
list labels an energy state; the first is the ground state, the rest
should be in order of increasing energy. Usually the term symbols
of the Dieke diagram are used.
\end{description}
\begin{lstlisting}
states:
    sensitizer_ion_label: Yb
    sensitizer_states_labels: [GS, ES]
    activator_ion_label: Tm
    activator_states_labels: [3H6, 3F4, 3H5, 3H4, 3F3, 1G4, 1D2]
\end{lstlisting}


The ion and state labels will be used to define excitation (Section
\ref{sub:Excitation}), decay (Section \ref{sub:Decay}), branching
ratios (Section \ref{sub:Branching-ratios}), and energy transfer
processes (Section \ref{sub:Energy-Transfer}).


\section{Excitation\label{sub:Excitation}}

At the beginning of the simulation, all ions are in their ground state.
An excitation source is necessary to pump them to an excited state.
This source can be pulsed for dynamics or continuous for steady state
simulations.

Any number of excitation subsections can be added to the file, and
at least one has to be active (see below). A two-color experiment
can be simulated by activating two excitations. Any number of excitations
can be active.

An excitation block contains several mandatory subsections:
\begin{description}
\item [{The~label}] is a short unique text. It identifies the excitation
and it is used in the naming of experimental data files (see Section
\ref{sub:The-expData-folder}), so short, informative names are encouraged. 
\item [{active}] can be true or false and indicates whether the excitation
will be used for the simulations. 
\item [{The~excitation~power~density}] in $\unit{W\,cm^{-2}}$. For
pulsed sources this has to be the instantaneous power density of the
pulse. Usual values are in the order of $\unit[10^{5}\text{\ensuremath{-}}10^{7}]{W\,cm^{-2}}$
for pulsed excitations and $\unit[10^{1}\text{\ensuremath{-}}10^{3}]{W\,cm^{-2}}$
for continuous excitations. 
\item [{The~pulse~width}] of the excitation source (in seconds) for pulsed
excitations. For continuous excitations it can be omitted. 
\item [{The~process}] is the actual absorption transition. The format
is \texttt{ion\_label(state\_label\_i) -> ion\_label(state\_label\_f)}.
Where the ion and state labels were defined in Section \ref{sub:States}.
Both ion labels have to be present and equal; both state labels have
to belong to the same ion type. 
\item [{The~degeneracy}] is the relative degeneracy of the initial and
final states. The relative degeneracy of two trivalent lanthanide
states with terms $^{2S_{i}+1}L_{iJ_{i}}$ and $^{2S_{f}+1}L_{fJ_{f}}$
is $g_{rel}=\frac{2J_{i}+1}{2J_{f}+1}$. 
\item [{The~pump~rate}] is the absorption cross-section divided by the
transition energy in units of $\unit{cm^{2}\,J^{-1}}$, that is $R_{P}=\frac{\sigma(\nu)}{h\nu}$.
The pump rate multiplied by the power density is equal to the absorption
probability, with units of $\unit{s^{-1}}$. 
\end{description}
An example with two excitation blocks:

\begin{lstlisting}
excitations:
    pulsed_1G4:
        active: True
        power_dens: 1e6
        t_pulse: 1e-8
        process: Tm(3H6) -> Tm(1G4)
        degeneracy: 13/9
        pump_rate: 9.3e-4
    CW_980nm:
        active: False
        power_dens: 1e2
        process: Yb(GS) -> Yb(ES)
        degeneracy: 4/3
        pump_rate: 4.4e-3
\end{lstlisting}



\subsection{Excited state absorption}

Excited state absorption (ESA) can be simulated by giving a list of
transitions, degeneracies and pump rates in the corresponding fields,
for example:

\begin{lstlisting}
excitations:
    NIR_800:
        active: False
        power_dens: 1e5
        t_pulse: 1e-8
        process: [Tm(3H6)->Tm(3H4), Tm(3H5)->Tm(1G4)] # list
        degeneracy: [13/9, 11/9] # list
        pump_rate: [4.4e-3, 4e-3] # list
\end{lstlisting}



\section{\label{sub:Decay}Decay}

This section contains the decay lifetimes in seconds. There are two
sections, one for the sensitizer and one for the activator. In both
cases the decay lifetimes are input with \texttt{state\_label: lifetime}:

\begin{lstlisting}
sensitizer_decay:
    ES: 2.5e-3
activator_decay:
    3F4: 12e-3
    3H5: 25e-6
    3H4: 2e-3
    3F3: 2e-6
    1G4: 760e-6
    1D2: 67.5e-6
\end{lstlisting}



\section{\label{sub:Branching-ratios}Branching ratios}

These are two optional sections, one for the sensitizer and one for
the activator.

The branching ratios describe the fraction of emission from an initial
state to a final state. The format is \texttt{initial\_state -> final\_state: ratio.}
The ratio is a number between zero and one. The branching ratio to
the ground state does not need to be specified because it is calculated
automatically from the other values.

\begin{lstlisting}
sensitizer_branching_ratios: # can be empty or simply omitted
activator_branching_ratios:
    3H5->3F4: 0.4
    3H4->3F4: 0.3
    3H4->3H5: 0.1
    3F3->3H4: 0.999
    1G4->3F4: 0.15
    1G4->3H5: 0.16
    1G4->3H4: 0.04
    1G4->3F3: 0.001
    1D2->3F4: 0.43
\end{lstlisting}



\section{\label{sub:Energy-Transfer}Energy transfer}

This optional section includes one or more energy transfer processes
between ions in the simulation. Each energy transfer block refers
to one process and contains several fields:
\begin{description}
\item [{The~label}] is a short unique text. It can also be used to restrict
the optimization to certain processes (Section \ref{sub:Optimization-Processes}). 
\item [{The~process}] describes the ET interaction with the format \texttt{ion\_label1(init\_state)
+ ion\_label2(init\_state) -> ion\_label1(end\_state) + ion\_label2(end\_state)}.
Where the ion and state labels were defined in Section \ref{sub:States}.
\item [{The~multipolarity}] of the interaction is an integer number, usually
6, 8 or 10.
\item [{The~strength}] of the interaction given in units of $\unit{s^{-1}\,\AA^{n}}$,
where $n$ is the multipolarity. Optionally, an interaction strength
for the average rate equation system can be given; this value is several
orders of magnitude lower than the microscopic value. If it is not
given and the average rate equations are solved, the normal strength
will be used.
\end{description}
For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
enery_transfer:
    CR50:
        process: Tm(1G4) + Tm(3H6) -> Tm(3H4) + Tm(3H5)
        multipolarity: 6
        strength: 4.3057e+09
        strength_avg: 8e+03 # optional, only for average system
    EM:
        process:  Yb(ES) + Yb(GS) -> Yb(GS) + Yb(ES)
        multipolarity: 6
        strength: 4.50220614e+10
\end{lstlisting}



\section{\label{sub:Optimization-Processes}Optimization processes}

An optional list of energy transfer labels. When optimizing the energy
transfer parameters to the experimental data (see Section \ref{sec:Optimizing-the-ET-params}),
by default all parameters will be used. This section restricts the
optimization parameters to those in the list, for example

\begin{lstlisting}
optimization_processes: [CR50]
\end{lstlisting}


will optimize only the parameter \texttt{CR50}, and not any other.


\section{\label{sub:Optimization-Method}Optimization method}

This optional section defines the method used to optimize the energy
transfer parameters to the experimental data. Several options are
available:
\begin{itemize}
\item SLSQP
\item COBYLA
\item L-BFGS-B
\item basin\_hopping
\item brute\_force
\end{itemize}
See the \emph{Notes} section in the \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html}{scipy minimize documentation}.
SLSQP (the default) or brute\_force are recommended, as they seem
to take the least time to arrive at the minimum.


\section{\label{sub:Power-Dependence}Power dependence}

This section is mandatory only if a power dependence simulation is
performed. The starting and ending power density values and the number
of steps need to be given

\begin{lstlisting}
power_dependence: [1e0, 1e7, 8]
\end{lstlisting}


Note that it uses a logarithmic scale, so the above configuration
will produce the power dependence at the following excitation power
densities: $10^{0}$, $10^{1}$, $10^{2}$, $10^{3}$, $10^{4}$,
$10^{5}$, $10^{6}$, and $\unit[10^{7}]{W\,cm^{-2}}$. See also Section
\ref{sec:Simulating-the-power-dep}.


\section{\label{sub:Concentration-Dependence}Concentration dependence}

This section is mandatory only if a concentration dependence simulation
is performed. It consists on a list of two lists; the first list gives
the sensitizer concentrations at which the simulation will take place,
the second gives the same for the activators.

\begin{lstlisting}
concentration_dependence: [[0, 0.5], [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]]
\end{lstlisting}


Note that everything else will remain constant; therefore, if the
number of unit cells is not high enough, at lower concentrations the
quality of the simulation may be low. See also Section \ref{sec:Simulating-the-concentration-dep}.


\section{Checking the configuration file}

To check that a configuration file is correct, execute:

\begin{lstlisting}
simetuc config_file.cfg
\end{lstlisting}


If no warnings or errors are displayed, the file is correct. Nonetheless,
it is still possible that some optional values are missing but needed
for a particular simulation type or have wrong values (e.g., negative
distances or concentrations above 100\%). In that case, this check
will not warn the user, and only trying to perform the actual simulation
will show if something is missing. In any case, the program never
fails silently, that is, it always warns the user if there was a problem
and how to fix it.

An example of a configuration file check that succeeded is shown in
Figure \ref{fig:Example-conf_file_correct}. An example of a check
failure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Example-conf_file_wrong}; in
this case, the name or the lattice has been omitted from the file.

\chapter{The logs and results folders}

\emph{simetuc} creates several subfolders during its usage; these
subfolders are located under the current working directory (the directory
from which \emph{simetuc} is being used). Additionally, the experimental
data must be saved in a folder with a specific format, see Section
\ref{sub:The-expData-folder}.


\section{The log folder}

Any operation of \emph{simetuc} writes its status and current tasks
on several log files, so the user can analyze what operations were
performed, when, and whether they succeeded. The log files are stored
in a subfolder called \texttt{logs}, which is created if it doesn't
exist.


\subsection{Normal log}

This is the primary log. Here all parts of the program register their
operations. For example, any operation begins with:

\begin{lstlisting}
2017-01-10 19:13:51,227 - simetuc       : INFO     Starting program...
\end{lstlisting}


The log format is the following:

\begin{lstlisting}
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,mmm - simetuc[.part]   : LEVEL    message
\end{lstlisting}


The main program emits messages under the name \emph{simetuc}, other
parts of the program have names such as \emph{simetuc.lattice} or
\emph{simetuc.simulations}. The log level can be DEBUG, INFO, WARNING,
or ERROR.


\subsection{\label{sub:Error-logs}Error log}

Whenever an operation was requested, but couldn't be completed due
to an user error or an internal bug, the errors are written to an
error log. This is log remains empty if all operations succeeded.


\subsection{Debug log}

This log registers a lot of low level information that is usually
not important, but can be relevant in the case of errors.


\section{The results folder\label{sec:The-results-folder}}

All simulations produce some results that are stored in the subfolder
results with the hdf5 format.


\section{Other folders}

The lattice folder, Section \ref{sub:The-latticeData-folder}.

The experimental data folder, see Section \ref{sub:The-expData-folder}.
